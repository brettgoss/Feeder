# Random Restaurant Picker

This project is a work in progress.
It is currently very barebones, but functional. I am working on building a frontend with MERN on feature/mern-setup

Picks a random restaurant from a json database generated from the City Of Victoria Open Data Portal.

Clone project and run `index.js` to use.
